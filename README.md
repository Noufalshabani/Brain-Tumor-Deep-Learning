## Introduction:
A brain tumor is a collection, or mass, of abnormal cells in your brain. Brain tumors can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). When benign or malignant tumors grow. This can cause brain damage, and it can be life-threatening.

\
&nbsp;

## Inspiration:

Building a model to determine whether there is a brain tumor or not and its type if any, using Convolutional Neural Networks
\
&nbsp;

## Dataset:
[It was uploaded in Kaggle, Click here to go to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)


\
&nbsp;

## Conclusion:

The importance of early diagnosis of brain tumor, as early diagnosis of brain tumor can contribute to ensuring immediate treatment that reduces the risks of death, and through artificial intelligence, we have contributed to building a model for diagnosing the brain tumor with high speed and accuracy.

## Future Work:
Develop the model to include all types of radiation

\
&nbsp;


## Tools:
1. Python Programming Language
2. Google Colaboratory
3. Tensorflow
4. Keras
5. Streamlit
6. PyCharm
7. PowerPoint
